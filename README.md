# Code Without Crying

This is a slow, no-pressure coding project.

Each lesson explains **one small idea at a time**, starting with HTML and CSS.
No rush. No overload. No textbook tone.

Just short explanations, simple examples, and the occasional bad joke.

## Why This Exists

Learning to code often feels:
- Too fast
- Too serious
- Too overwhelming

This project does the opposite.

Small lessons. Clear ideas. You can stop anytime.

---

## How to Use This

- Read one lesson
- Try the example
- Move on when you feel ready

That’s it.

No deadlines. No roadmap pressure.

---

## Who This Is For

- Beginners
- Self-learners
- People who think coding is “not for them”

If you’re curious and patient, you’re welcome here.
